# SMS Spam Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for building a SMS spam detection system using deep learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify text messages as either spam or not spam (ham).

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model can be found in the `dataset` directory. It includes a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- [Other dependencies...]

You can install them using the following command:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Model Architecture
The deep learning model architecture is defined in the model.py file. You can customize the architecture or experiment with different models to improve performance.

## Results
Details about the model's performance on the test set, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, can be found in the results directory.
